# AMNH Marine Specimens Validation Tool

## Goal

Create a simple but proficient Serverless Form for the volunteers to use.

* It should work offline with a few limitations (external API's)
* It should not require mantainment


### User Profile

* The users are 60-65+ year old volunteers who work with the tool for 6-8h periods once or twice a week.
* They are not familiar with excel and would require clear instructions and controlls

### The work flow

* The user must enter his name/username
* The application must export the works day to a csv file
* The CSV will have a timestamp and the username as it's name

### The Form

The form will be divided in different sections, each section will have it's own notes field 

#### 0. User Name
	* Enter in Name, save in session storage
  		* Text field

#### 1. Id's and tracking data

	* Tracking number will be autogenerated
  		* timestamp (year-month-day-hour-minute, not unix) + user-name
	* Catalog number
  		* optional, string
	* Barcode number
  		* optional, string
	* Notes
  		* optional, textarea

#### 2. Taxnomony
	
	Let's test worms API
    idea: use an iframe or otherwise display the returned data from the API to help the volunteers choose the right data to enter 

	* Verbatim **req**
	  * take the verbatim, pass it to WORMS api, and see if we can populate the other fields with the response 
	* Class
	* Subclass
	* Order
	* Suborder
	* Family 
	* Genus 
	* Species 
	* Notes

#### 3. Determined by
Data about a person. 

	#####  TBD: need to figure out if there is a fixed or maximum numbers of "determined by"

	* Repeater fields
      * Verbatim
        * how it was written originally on the label 
      * First Name
      * Middle Name 1
      * Middle name 2
      * First Last Name
      * Second Last Name
      * Year - date
    * Notes
    	* for the entire section (not per person) 

#### 4. Specimen data
	
	* # of specimens
		* int
	* storage medium **closed set**
		* multiselect
	* type of type **closed set**
		* multiselect	 
	* sex **closed set**
		* radio 	
	* development stage **closed set**
		* multiselect	 
	* body part location
		* string
	*  Notes

#### 5. Host Data (optional section)
Host is the sample this specimen was found in/on/at
OPTIONAL section

	* Found in a host
		* bool 
		* T: show form, F: send blank form
	* Host catalog number
	* Host relationship
	* Host species
	* Host genus name
	* Host sex
		* radio  
	* Host condition
	* Notes

#### 6. Collector Data (collecting method is ambiguous)

	* Collecting method
		* string 
	* Collector -> repeater field extends 3. Determined By
		* reuse same determined by components
		* "infinite" amount of collectors
	* Verbatim date
		* string 
	* collected from (date)
		* 3 fields, all optional (D/M/Y) 
	* collected to (date)
		* 3 fields, all optional (D/M/Y)  
	* Expedition name
	* Notes

#### 7. Location Information
* autocomplete box at the top --> google maps API (or mapbox)
* complications: when a natural landmark comes back, we don't know what type it is and would need a secondary modal/dropdown
* Lat/Long will come back with autocomplete

	* Continent
	* Ocean
	* sea/gulf/strait
	* Lake/pond/reservoir

	* Specific Locale
	* Temperature 
		* should allow for input in F or C and convert the other field
	* Lat from
	* Long from
	* Lat to
	* Long to
	* Link to online old lat/long to decimal lat long converter
		* if it's easy, we can try to do this programatically for them  
	* Notes

#### 8. Donor's Data

	* Donor's data extends 3. Determined By
		*  * reuse "determined by" components
		* "infinite" amount of donors
